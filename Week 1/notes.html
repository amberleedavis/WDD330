    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        While reading "Doing Stuff with Web Things", I'm learning about local storage.
        I honestly have never heard of the term "local storage" before, or maybe I have and I 
        don't remember. From what I understand, local storage helps pair things together.
        In the story editor example, the story tself (storyHTML) should be labeled the actual
        name the story (storyName). Essentally, key value pairs are stored are saved in a web browser.

        After doing my own research in w3schools, I also found out that local storage has no expiraton date,
        and the data will not be deleted when the browser is closed. It can be accessed at any time, but it will be
        read-only. This will be handy with applications. In the reading it mentions that no one would want to use an
        app that can't remember what you did the last time you visited.
